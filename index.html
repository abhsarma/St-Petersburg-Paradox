                <h4 class="margin-top-md">The St. Petersburg Paradox</h4>
                <p>This paradox describes a theoretical lottery game which results in a random variable with infinite expected value but nevertheless would be of only small value to participants.</p>
                <p class="margin-top-sm"><i>"A casino offers a game of chance for a single player in which a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The initial stake starts at 2 dollars and is doubled every time heads appears. The first time tails appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player wins 2 dollars if tails appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if heads appears on the first toss and tails on the second, 8 dollars if heads appears on the first two tosses and tails on the third, and so on. What would be a fair price to pay the casino for entering the game?"</i></p><p style="text-align: right">- Wikipedia</p>
                <p class="margin-top-sm">Ideally, the price to enter the game should be determined by the average payout of the game. The expected value is:</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="images/expectation.jpg">
                <p class="margin-top-sm">Assuming the game can continue as long as the coin toss results in heads and in particular that the casino has unlimited resources, this sum is unbound and so the expected win for repeated play is an infinite amount of money. Considering nothing but the expected value of the net change in one's monetary wealth, one should therefore play the game at any price if offered the opportunity. However, most people would not be willing to pay more than a very small amount of money.</p>
